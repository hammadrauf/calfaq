DESCRIPTION
-----------

  These functions are an implementation in the C language of the formulas
  presented in the Calendar FAQ at
  http://www.tondering.dk/claus/calendar.html.

  The documentation of each function is found in the .c and .h files.

  The implementation follows the formulas mentioned in the FAQ quite closely.
  The focus of the implementation is on simplicity and clarity. For this
  reason, no complex data structures or classes are used, nor has any attempt
  been made to optimize the code. Also, no verification of the input
  parameters is performed (except in the function simple_gregorian_easter).

  All numbers (including Julian Day Numbers which currently have values of
  almost 2,500,000) are assumed to be representable as variables of type
  'int'.
